# IOZone benchmarks on ODroid HC1

All benchmarks run against a 64Gb SSD that had been previously been used
and not trimmed before starting these benchamrks.

* Self built kernel from ODroid GitHub with debug symbols (don't you just hate it when building with debug symbols makes a fully reproducible sudden death bug disappear?)
* iozone built from AUR.
* Stderr files are omitted as they were empty.
* `.report` files are "Excel compatible file(s) that contains the results".
* `.graph` files are plain text equivalents.

## Commands

## USB2

```
iozone -a -b ~/iozone.usb.ssd.report -R > ~/iozone.usb.ssd.graphs 2> ~/iozone.usb.ssd.stderr
```

## SATA

```
iozone -a -b ~/iozone.sata.ssd.report -R > ~/iozone.sata.ssd.graphs 2> ~/iozone.sata.ssd.stderr
```
